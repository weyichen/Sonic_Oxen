Wireless ECG system for Cardiac Stress Tests
============================================

Description
-----------
ECGs are vital for the measurement and diagnosis of abnormal rhythms of the heart, particularly those associated with electrolyte imbalances or damage to conductive tissues.  However, the utility of ECGs depends on the detection of electrical signals whose magnitude lies in the order of millivolts.  As such, ECG measurements are particularly subject to the influence of noise.  In the clinic, the motion of wires during cardiac stress tests visibly introduces noise into the ECG signal, while impairing patient movement.  Data collection during cardiac stress tests would greatly benefit from the use of wireless ECG systems, which would help minimize the error introduced into the data by disturbance of physical components of the systems. Existing wireless ECG systems are either too bulky and uncomfortable for use during exercise, or implement an insufficient number of electrodes to produce data accurate enough for diagnostic purposes. Thus, our goal is to develop an ECG system that will improve signal-to-noise ratio, and preserve data bandwidth while conforming to a certain size limit.  Our system will use wireless modules to transmit ECG data in real-time from patient electrodes to a signal processor that can be connected to computer terminals.  This ECG system will be extremely useful for collecting ECG data in the clinic, particularly during examinations that require patient movement.  Additionally, this system may have other applications where there is a demand for wearable wireless systems, e.g. for real-time vitals monitoring.

Problem
-------
The movement of wires attached to ECG monitors, which causes patient discomfort and signal noise issues during cardiac stress tests.

Existing solutions
-----------------

Bulky to be worn for patient - probably impossible for children, bluetooth so less secure, low range, energy intensive

There are other lighter and wearable options with only one lead.

Our Method
----------
Use wireless modules to transmit ECG data in real-time from electrodes attached to patientâ€™s body to a signal processor linked to a computer terminal. Reduce the amount of wires to minimize noise. A wearable design also.

Other Applications
------------------
Heart monitor for mountaineers, plus other situations where wireless system would be more convenient.
